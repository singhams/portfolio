## Overview
An industry-leading desktop video editing application is widely used by professional editors, but its power comes at the cost of a steep learning curve. The product team wanted to explore how to make it more approachable for creators who don’t specialize in video, without degrading the experience for core professional users.

I led a multi-cohort UX research study to identify friction points, opportunities for delight, and usability baselines for upcoming redesigns.

## My Role
- **Lead UX Researcher:** Designed study, led sessions, synthesized findings, presented actionable recommendations.  
- Collaborated with product managers, designers, and engineering leads.  
- Created a scoring framework for both task completion and qualitative sentiment to benchmark future improvements.

## Participants
- **Total:** 12 participants across 3 cohorts (4 per group)  
  - **Video CPros:** Experienced professional editors  
  - **Non-video CPros:** Creative pros with little-to-no video experience  
  - **Social Video Creators (SVCs):** Creators producing short-form video for social platforms  
- Recruited through social media and user lists

## Study Design
- **Persona Validation:** Understanding each participant’s role, editing experience, and tools used  
- **Task Scenarios:** Realistic editing tasks — importing, organizing, editing, adding effects, and exporting  
- **Reflection:** Open discussion on challenges, surprises, and impressions

## Metrics
- **Task Completion:** Could the user complete the task without prompts? (0–2 scale)  
- **Qualitative Sentiment:** Did the experience feel positive, neutral, or negative? (0–2 scale)  
- **Dual scoring:** Ensured inter-rater reliability (90% agreement)

## Key Insights

### Novices could succeed — but only with a safety net
- Non-video CPros finished most tasks with prompts, but admitted they’d abandon the tool in real life after a few minutes of frustration (often returning to simpler tools like iMovie).

### Pros are efficient, but not delighted
- Video CPros completed nearly every task without assistance but rarely expressed positive sentiment, scoring around “neutral” for most interactions.

### Common Friction Points Across All Cohorts
- **Source Monitor confusion:** Novices misinterpreted its purpose; pros found it redundant in certain workflows  
- **Accidental overwrites:** Dragging new clips or titles often replaced existing content unexpectedly  
- **Hidden or mislabeled panels:** “Text” panel opened captions; graphics editing buried under “Browse” instead of “Edit”  
- **Volume control discoverability:** Required tagging before controls appeared; terminology (“Audio Gain”) didn’t match user mental models  
- **Missed export optimizations:** Social sharing presets were rarely noticed  

### Missed Opportunities for Delight
- **Freeform view:** Sparked initial excitement but fell short due to quirks and inconsistencies  
- **MOGRT customization:** Huge time-saver for SVCs, but many didn’t know saved versions were possible until training events  
- **Creative looks/LUTs workflow:** Suffered from poor preview design and import friction

## Recommendations
- Streamlined onboarding: default bins for footage, audio, graphics in the import workflow  
- Optional magnetic timeline to prevent accidental overwrites  
- Clearer visual affordances for zoom controls  
- Panel renaming: e.g., “Captions” instead of “Text”; separate “Browse” and “Edit” for graphics  
- Always-visible volume control without tagging requirement  
- Color workspace redesign with improved preview experience  
- Better discoverability for MOGRT saving and social presets

## Impact
- Provided a baseline usability benchmark for future design iterations  
- Findings directly informed the tool’s import/export redesigns and UI panel reorganization  
- Helped the team prioritize discoverability and prevent unintentional destructive actions without adding complexity for professionals
