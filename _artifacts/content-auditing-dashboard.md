These gifs show portions of a content auditing dashboard prototype I created using Amazon Quicksight. The dashboard allows you to search for content based on taxonomy tags as well as terms that appear in the content URL. Itâ€™s intended to help strategists find gaps and inconsistencies in their catalog, so they can be corrected.
