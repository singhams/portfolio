title: Journey Map w/ Information Needs

This journey map illustrates a typical travel planner’s process — from deciding where to go, to choosing accommodations, to planning activities. The high-level phases originated from earlier research and were refined based on findings from a user study I led.

Unlike a standard journey map, this artifact layers in travelers’ specific information needs at each stage. These needs are especially critical during the mid-journey “research and planning” phases, where our client’s travel app competes head-to-head with other tools. Mapping these needs directly to the journey highlights exactly where the design must deliver clear, relevant, and differentiating content to win engagement.
