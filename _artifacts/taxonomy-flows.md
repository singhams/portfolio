This diagram maps where enterprise taxonomy data is stored and how it flows between systems. Itâ€™s a simplified, redacted version of a comprehensive diagram developed for a client. The original was the product of a collaborative team effort to uncover and document the complex connections between enterprise taxonomies and the systems that rely on them.
