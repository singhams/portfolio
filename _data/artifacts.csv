Content Auditing Dashboard,article,specific-tag-cropped.gif,1,true,"These gifs show portions of a content auditing dashboard prototype I created using Amazon Quicksight. The dashboard allows you to search for content based on taxonomy tags as well as terms that appear in the content URL. It’s intended to help strategists find gaps and inconsistencies in their catalog, so they can be corrected.

Navigation Model,article,nav-model.png,2,true,"This diagram maps the pathways a user might take to find a specific product on Funko.com. In this scenario, Jill wants to discover Hermione Granger figurines but isn’t sure how to spell her name. She can search using terms like ‘Harry Potter’ or browse through characters or product categories. The flow highlights her journey and shows how different navigation options support findability and discovery.

Ontology Model,article,ontology.jpg,3,true,"A high-level diagram mapping the core classes and relationships in our client’s Help & Learn content domain. I built the model in RDF, hand-coding it in Turtle (TTL) within VS Code, and then configured it in TopBraid as a proof of concept.

Content Pipelines,article,pipelines.jpg,6,true,"A high-level system diagram proposing a new architecture for a client’s content pipelines—supporting both an LLM-based chatbot and a traditional search/filter experience for help content.

The design shifts tagging away from individual authoring platforms (e.g., WordPress) to PoolParty as the central “semantic layer” for taxonomy and metadata management, while introducing a more robust automated tagging capability.

Journey Map,article,journey.png,7,false,"This journey map illustrates a typical travel planner’s process — from deciding where to go, to choosing accommodations, to planning activities. The high-level phases originated from earlier research and were refined based on findings from a user study I led.

Unlike a standard journey map, this artifact layers in travelers’ specific information needs at each stage. These needs are especially critical during the mid-journey “research and planning” phases, where our client’s travel app competes head-to-head with other tools. Mapping these needs directly to the journey highlights exactly where the design must deliver clear, relevant, and differentiating content to win engagement.

Wireframes,article,wire-after-a.png,8,false,"Slides from a findings & recommendations report

I recommended redesigning intranet page layouts so different page types would have distinct visual structures, helping users quickly recognize where they were and what to expect.

Taxonomy Flows,article,taxo-flows.jpg,9,false,"This diagram maps where enterprise taxonomy data is stored and how it flows between systems. It’s a simplified, redacted version of a comprehensive diagram developed for a client.
